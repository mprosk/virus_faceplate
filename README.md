# Access Virus TI2 Vocoder Faceplate

When using the vocoder built into the Virus TI series synthesizer, the knobs and buttons of the filter section are replaced with vocoder-specific functions. This faceplate slides over the filter section, providing legends and references when using the vocoder.

PDF versions are included for creating printed versions at home. Some trial-and-error for correct scaling may be required.
